# 3D-Partial-U-Net
The source code with our proposed 3D Partial U-Net is available here.<br>
The `visual` folder provides the code for 2D and 3D visualization in the article. <br>
`3D Partial U-Net.py` is the source code for the network architecture we propose. <br>
`BR_compare.py` provides the code for comparing BR and our proposed LBROM. <br>
Due to confidentiality agreements, we regret that we cannot disclose the head and neck lymph node dataset. However, we welcome researchers to use our model in their own 3D medical image segmentation work, and we will validate the effectiveness of the model on public datasets in the future.
